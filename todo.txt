	Intro
	"Our team members will take you through their areas of research and Im here to give you a introduction
	Pathfinding intro, closely related to shortest path problem
	Our implementation focuses on an aplpiaation that lends well to game pathfinding, but the theory
		is applicable to many other problems.

	"Hello everyone and welcome to our video presentation of our research project."

	"Our project is an exploration of implementation and comparison of various pathfinding algorithm
	in a concurrent context."

	"Each of our team members will take you through their part of the project. I'm Evan Combs, and 
	I'm here to give you an introduction to our project."
	
	"The goals of our project is mainly one of exploration and data collection.
	We are interested in benefits and deficits of various algorithms, finding the best algorithsm
	for a given circumstance, and what kind of applications such algorithms are suited for.
	
	"Additionally, we have a focus on the process of converting sequential algorthms to concurrent,
	and the feasibility of doing so.
	
	"Our project is interested in pathfinding, with is a class of problems related to finding a 
	way to get from one point to another."

	"Pathfinding has many application in gaming, optimization, simulation and more, and is closely
	related to the shortest path problem in graph theory. Many pathfinding problems are represented
	and solved as graphs, which is the approach we take."

	"In order to accurately compare differing algorithms we have built and implemented a shared
	testing framework called Layout. Layout is essentially a ghraph representation data structure,
	that all our algorithms are built to work on. By compalring them on the same data, we ensure
	that we have a fair metric to examine them on.
