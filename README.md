## Project Statement
In our project we intend to explore the use of concurrency in path finding algorithms effects performance, and how various pathfinding algorithms can be made concurrent. Does the type of path finding algorithm have an effect on the implementation of concurrency or the increase in performance?

Based on the difficulty of implementing concurrency in different path finding algorithms we want to implement them ourselves and perform extensive testing. We would also like to include a visual representation of these path finding algorithms with concurrency implemented to physically show the increase in performance. Should time allow, we would also be interested in exploring applications of parallelized pathfinding algorithms.

## Approach
